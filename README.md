# Hello-world
My first repository...

Hello everyone!

I'm very excited to join GitHub and start working on my SQL, Java, Javascript and HTML. I might even be able to learn python!

I have a BS in Information Science from UNC SILS. I love outdoor stuff and world of warcraft. 

I look forward to one day taking on the taco diet.

Best

B
